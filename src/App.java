/* Complete methods: copyFrontAndBack and __________. 
 * DO NOT MODIFY THE MAIN METHOD!
 *
 *Array task: Complete the method copyFrontAndBack. 
 *
 * This method:
 *  -takes in an array of integers that will have a length of at least 1. 
 *  -If the original array was length 2 or more, return a new array of 
 *  length 2 that contains the first and last elements from the original 
 *  array. 
 *  -If the original array was length 1, return an array of length 2 where both 
 *  elements are equal to the contents of the original array
 * 
 * An example of this method working is included in the main method
 * 
 * 
 *Split task: Complete the method maxWordLength
 * 
 * This method:
 *  -takes in a sentence stored in a String  
 *  -returns the length of the longest word in that String
 *  
 * Remember that you can use .length() to find the length of a word
 * 
 * An example of this method working is included in the main method
